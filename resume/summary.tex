I am looking for a full-time apprenticeship or job in UK to gain experience in web development or associated with it fields. Although I currently reside in Almaty, Kazakhstan, being a British/Russian citizen, I can quickly join your team providing I pass an online interview and tests if any. I am ready to settle in any location in UK required to conduct my duties but would appreciate close interaction with the senior colleagues to obtain the appropriate knowledge fast and become more useful to the team. \break Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills and general background in web developing.
